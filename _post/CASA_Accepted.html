            Abstract

        Image inpainting is a field that has been traditionally attempted in the field of computer vision.<br/>
        After the development of deep learning, image inpainting has been advancing endlessly together with convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks.<br/>
        Thereafter, it has been expanded to various fields such as image filing through guiding and image inpainting using various masking.<br/>
        Furthermore, the field termed image outpainting has also been pioneered. Meanwhile, after the recent announcement of the vision transformer, various computer vision problems have been attempted using the vision transformer.<br/> 
        In this paper, we are trying to solve the problem of image generalization painting using the vision transformer. <br/>
        This is an attempt to fill images with painting no matter whether the areas where painting is missing are in or out of the images, and without guiding.<br/>
        To that end, the painting problem was defined as a problem to drop images in patch units for easy use in the vision transformer.<br/>
        And we solved the problem with a simple network structure created by slightly modifying the vision transformer to fit the problem. <br/>
        We named this network PIPformers. PIPformers achieved better values than other papers compared on PSNR, RMSE and SSIM.<br/>
