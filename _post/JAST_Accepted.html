            Abstract

        In a duck cage, ducks are placed in various states.<br/>
        In particular, if a duck is overturned and falls or dies, it will adversely affect the growing environment.<br/> 
        In order to prevent the foregoing, it was necessary to continuously manage the cage for duck growth. <br/>
        This study proposes a method using an object detection algorithm to improve the foregoing.<br/>
        Object detection refers to the work to perform classification and localization of all objects present in the image when an input image is given.<br/>
        To use an object detection algorithm in a duck cage, data to be used for learning should be made and the data should be augmented to secure enough data to learn from.<br/>
        In addition, the time required for object detection and the accuracy of object detection are important.<br/>
        The study collected, processed, and augmented image data for a total of two years in 2021 and 2022 from the duck cage.<br/>
        Based on the objects that must be detected, the data collected as such were divided at a ratio of  9 : 1, and learning and verification were performed.<br/>
        The final results were visually confirmed using images different from the images used for learning.<br/>
        The proposed method is expected to be used for minimizing human resources in the growing process in duck cages and making the duck cages into smart farms.
